# NBA-Bets-Data

The following repository contains Python dataframes with exported SQL queries from my Oracle SQL relational database with NBA bets that I'm working on for a couple of months now. I'm going to break them down, analyze and visiualize the data from them in another repo that's pinned on my profile - NBA Bets Breakdown. Over here you can have a quick glimpse on the df's, what kind of data they're containing, what its shape is coming down for. I've been gathering the data since 10th of December and I'll be doing so until the end of the season (around April), so the df's will be getting updated on a regular basis. The bets are coming from a Polish sportsbook provider betclic.pl. Enjoy!
