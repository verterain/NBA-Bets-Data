# NBA-Bets-Data

The following repository contains Python dataframes with exported SQL queries from my Oracle SQL relational database with NBA bets that I'm working on for a couple of months now. I'm going to break them down, analyze and visiualize the data from them in another repo that's pinned on my profile - NBA Bets Breakdown. Over here you can have a quick glimpse on the df's, what kind of data they're containing, what its shape is coming down for. Enjoy!
